    <h1>My Career Path</h1> <img src="assets/img/MBA.png" height="250" width="800" alt="MBA pic">
    <p>My career started off in a management training program learning to run a brick and mortar car rental business at Enterprise. This is an strong sales and service position and <br>leads to promotion through company milestones. I learned to put the customer first with there time, demands, and convenience. Running a business requires planning, <br>forecasting, employee development, and financial discipline. I enjoyed supporting businesses financially and making decisions to impact growth, so eventually I worked as an <br>area accountant from other managers. After spending more than two years working in Hawaii I moved to Utah to pursue more opportunities professionally and academically. <!--<br>I worked as a financial analyst for Tesla and Franklincovey. I helped Tesla build a better process with wire payment approvals and avoid fraudulent requests. We identified <br>$13 million in fraudulent payments and built a team to better serve this need. At Franklicovey, many month-end processes needed consistency. I helped develop a financial <br>model to calculate product royalties for key business partners. This helped us execute $300,000 of back royalty payments.--> <br>I received the opportunity to work on the revenue side of accounting, managing a book of clients, and providing specialized investment services. This lead me to want to support <br>business units with budgets, forecasts, and financial performance. My ideal path is to work in corporate finance and work towards a CFO position.</p>
